# Agenda

* Git in general
* Working with local and remote branches
* Not sure if this is that awesome but mandatory Branching und related bäst practices
* Rebases/Merges
* Lé Conf-lict reso-lving
* Stashing
* .gitconfig

**ASK QUESTIONS ANYTIME**

---

# Git in general

* Distributed Version Control System
* Successor of CSV, Subversion and inspired by closed source Bitkeeper
* Easier to work with as a team than predecessors
* Originally made by Linus Torvalds to improve Linux Kernel development 
* Nowadays embraced even by Microsoft
* `Github !== Git`

## Github

* SaaS-service for hosting Git repositories and related tools
* Bitbucket
* Gitlab
* Host your own :)

---

## What the name means:

* random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command. The fact that it is a mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
* stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of slang.
* "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
* "goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks

---

# How to start

* Get Git magically to your computer. (Ubuntu: `apt install git`, Mac: Install Xcode, Windows install Git from the official site)
* Don't use GUIs, use git CLI. _(exception: Use PHPStorm for conflict resolving)._
* Sooner or later you'll face problems that force you to CLI anyway.

## Git init

* `git init` creates .git directory into your working directory => Local repository
* To create new _local_ repository: 
```bash 
mkdir project-folder
cd project-folder
git init
nano .gitignore
```

---

## Remote repository

* Create new repo in Github
* Push your repo to Github (don't worry too much, Github will tell you what to do):
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:trm42/test-repo.git
git push -u origin master
```

---

# Git clone

* Use ssh as protocol
* ssh-keygen, copy the $HOME/.ssh/id*.pub keyfile content to Github
* ^ don't add password to that key as that will hinder your workflow
* **Never send / publish the non public keyfile anywhere**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:trm42/test-repo.git [directory to clone into]
```

---

# Git log

* Tells the whole commit history
* `git log filename` tells what commits have touched the file
* Prettier and easier to read: 

```
git log --color --graph --pretty=format:\'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s 
%Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset\' --abbrev-commit
```

---

# Git blame

* Does what the name says
* `git blame FILENAME`
* Who has modified the file and what lines and in what commit

---


# Git branch

* List branches and see current: `git branch`
* Create Branch: `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME`. Make sure you're branching from right branch!
* Checkout a branch: `git checkout EXISTING_BRANCH_NAME`
* Pull latest changes from upstream: `git pull`
* Rename local branch : `git branch -m NEW_BRANCH_NAME`
* delete: `git branch -D DELETABLE_BRANCH_NAME`

---

# Branching strategies 

* One feature per branch 
* Sensible units of work
* Avoid mega branches


## Bigger set of features:

* Make feature set main branch. Example: `UK-2021-new-invoice-process`
* Make every feature as a separate feature/task branch, make PRs for them and merge to feature set branch
* `UK-2022-send-invoices-to-ireland`
* `UK-2023-fix-devil-signs-invoices`
* `UK-2024-revert-who-creates-these-prs-fix-this-bleeep`

---

# Branch naming

* Feature branches `UK-123-fix-brainfarts`
* Add descriptive verb after ticket number: `fix, hotfix, change, delete, add`

## Branches

* Develop === For long term development projects
* Release candidate / Staging  === Last fortress before master. Deployed to staging envs
* Master === Production branch. Everything merged here gets deployed to production


---

# Git stage

* Stage of changed files
* `git status`
* Normal usage `git add FILES OR DIRECTORIES`
* Creates SHA hash for your file 
* `git add -p` goes through all changes and offers them separately to be added
* **Avoid** `git add .` Use bash completion if it makes life easier
* To take files off from stage `git reset FILES OR DIRECTORIES`  
* To reset files to their pre-modified state `git checkout FILE OR DIRECTORIES`

---

# Git commit 

* Adds your staged changes to your local version history
* Create good commit messages
* Actually describe **what** you have done and **WHY**
* `git commit` Opens defined $EDITOR for writing the commit message. 
* `git commit -m "Fix brainfart und wolf because... OMAGOD WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE"`
* `git commit -m "Fix annoying bug that breaks things In FoobarController as bars were running out " --amend` (works only before push)

---

## Suggestions for possible commit rules

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

## Short Examples

* `Move composer.json require-dev doctrine/dbal to require as it is needed in staging and prod as they do only composer install --no-dev as they are supposed to be doing`
* `Delete all validation lang files because translations are responsibility of the frontends`
* `Fixing fix of the fix of the fix`
* `Fixing brainfarty blob of blob`

---

## Long Commit Message Example

Longer read: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
you omit the body entirely); various tools like `log`, `shortlog`
and `rebase` can get confused if you run the two together.

Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
change? Here's the place to explain them.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

 - Bullet points are okay, too
 - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
   by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
   vary here

If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
like this:

Resolves: #123
See also: #456, #789

---

# Git push

* Pushes changes to upstream (Github or Bitbucket repository)
* Usually straightforward when the upstream branch has been set (`git push --set-upstream origin UK-123`)
* If you're creating a new pull request, remember to go to Github and create the PR :)
* After rebase: `git push --force` so the git PR history gets back to normal
* Don't push to branches which have been already merged

# Git pull

* Usually nothing special although may induce git merge if the local and upstream has different commits
* In that case `git merge abort` may be good idea...

---

# Git diff

* `git diff -r BRANCH OR GIT COMMIT HASH`
* Diffmerge and diff-so-fancy makes life more fun <3 

---

# Github workflow

* `git checkout release-candidate`
* `git pull`
* `git branch -b UK-999-remove-brainfarts`
* Lots of `git commit`s
* `git push --set-upstream origin UK-999-remove-brainfarts`
* Head to Github and create pull request
* Pester others until they make CRs
* Fix CR stuff
* Commit and Push
* Wait for approval
* (rebase + push --force if needed)
* Merge to RC (Deployment to Staging etc)
* RC gets merged to Master (Deployment to Production)

---

# Merge vs Rebase?

https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing
* Merging is non-destructive. Just a new merge commit down the line

## Merge

* Good for merging branches into mainline. That's how Github does it
* Bad for keeping Git log understandable in the long run

---

## Rebase

* Old commits are put below the new commits -> linear commit log
* Not for public branches (master, release candidate) without coordination
* Requires force push
* If working in a branch for more than one day, one should rebase the branch quite often when starting the work, helps to see possible problems earlier
* Git rerere (if you need to resolve same stuff multiple times, this is a life saver <3 )
* `git rebase origin/release-candidate`
* `git rebase --continue`
* `git rebase --skip`
* `git rebase --abort`

* Rebase order matters. UK-114 -> UK->113 -> UK->82 -> Release Candidate

---

## Conflict resolve

* PHPStorm's conflict resolve is awesome. Use that.
* Automatic resolve is good for most changes, concentrate on conflicts.

---

# Git cherry-pick

* *Sometimes* it's easier to pick 1-2 commits from another branch to another
* `git cherry-pick COMMIT HASH`
* **Don't try to use it on bigger things**. Easy to mess up things!

---

# Git stash

* Helps with uncommitted work when you don't want to commit them yet but need to change branch temporarily
* Literally stashes your work away

* `git stash`
* `git stash list`
* `git stash apply STASH_NUMBER`

---

# GURU Stuff

* ~/.gitconfig (shortcuts, rerere)
